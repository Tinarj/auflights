auflights is an R data package of Australian aviation activity before,
during and after COVID-19. It brings together monthly domestic and
international route data, airport traffic, air fare indices, CPI,
exchange rates and air-distance tables so that students and researchers
can explore how travel patterns and costs have changed from roughly
2016–2025.
