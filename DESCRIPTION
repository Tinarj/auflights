Description: auflights is an R data package of Australian aviation activity
    before, during and after COVID-19. It brings together monthly domestic and
    international route data, airport traffic, air fare indices, CPI, exchange
    rates and air-distance tables so that students and researchers can explore
    how travel patterns and costs have changed from roughly 2016–2025.
